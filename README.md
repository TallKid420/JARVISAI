# JARVIS
 
This is a home assistant or you could call it JARVIS. It was all the ability's of a home assistant and can do thing like tell the weather or pull up the news you name it. It was created in python with json serving as its database. It can tell if people have already talked to jarvis and if not will deny them access.Â It is still in development and in its beta stage but works amazing. I am adding the ability to learn voices and more.

All of JARVIS is open to the public but I would love a donation to help fund projects like this
